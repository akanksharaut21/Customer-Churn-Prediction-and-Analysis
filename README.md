# 📊 Customer Churn Prediction & Dashboard  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using **machine learning (Python in Google Colab)** and visualizes insights through **Tableau dashboards**. The goal is to help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies by combining **predictive modeling** with **interactive business intelligence**.  

---

## 🚀 Key Steps  

### 1. Data Preparation (Google Colab)  
- Cleaned telco dataset (tenure, monthly charges, total charges, contract type, etc.).  
- Engineered new features (Tenure Buckets, Churn Flag, Churn Rate %).  
- Built ML models to predict churn probability.  
- Exported outputs:  
  - `churn_prediction.csv` → customer churn probability results.  
  - `feature_importance_top20.csv` → top 20 drivers of churn.  

### 2. Tableau Dashboard  
- Imported cleaned dataset + ML outputs.  
- Created KPIs: **Churn Rate %, Total Customers, Avg. Monthly Charges**.  
- Built calculated fields: Churn Flag, Tenure Buckets, Predicted Class.  
- Added interactive filters: **Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method, Senior Citizen**.  
- Implemented parameterized **Probability Threshold** for flexible classification.  
- Designed intuitive dashboards for executives to track churn trends.

## 📊 Deliverables  
- **Machine Learning Output:** CSV files with predictions & feature importance.  
- **Tableau Dashboard:** Visual insights by tenure, contract type, charges, and customer segments.  
- **KPIs & Filters:** Business-friendly indicators for decision-making.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- **Python (Google Colab):** Data preprocessing, model training, predictions.  
- **Pandas, Scikit-learn:** Data wrangling & ML.  
- **Tableau:** Interactive dashboards & visualization.  

---

## 🎯 Outcomes  
- Identified **top churn drivers** (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges).  
- Highlighted **high-risk customers** using model predictions.  
- Delivered a **data-driven decision support system** for customer retention.

## 📌 Usage Instructions  
1. Open Tableau → Connect Data → Load `telco_clean.csv`, `churn_prediction.csv`, and `feature_importance_top20.csv`.  
2. Create calculated fields & filters (Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method, Senior Citizen).  
3. Build dashboards with KPIs and apply filters.  
4. Use parameterized **Probability Threshold** to adjust churn classification.  
5. Explore churn insights to support retention strategies.
