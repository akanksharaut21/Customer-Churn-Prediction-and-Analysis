# ðŸ“Š Customer Churn Prediction & Dashboard

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project predicts customer churn for a telecommunications company using machine learning (Python in Google Colab) and visualizes insights through Tableau dashboards. The goal is to help businesses identify at-risk customers and improve retention strategies by combining predictive modeling with interactive business intelligence.

## ðŸš€ Key Steps

### 1. Data Preparation (Google Colab)

* Cleaned telco dataset (tenure, monthly charges, total charges, contract type, etc.).
* Engineered new features (Tenure Buckets, Churn Flag, Churn Rate %).
* Built ML models to predict churn probability.
* Exported outputs:

  * churn_prediction.csv â†’ customer churn probability results.
  * feature_importance_top20.csv â†’ top 20 drivers of churn.

### 2. Tableau Dashboard

* Imported cleaned dataset + ML outputs.
* Created KPIs: Churn Rate %, Total Customers, Avg. Monthly Charges.
* Built calculated fields: Churn Flag, Tenure Buckets, Predicted Class.
* Added interactive filters: Contract, Internet Service, Payment Method, Senior Citizen.
* Implemented parameterized Probability Threshold for flexible classification.
* Designed intuitive dashboards for executives to track churn trends.

## ðŸ“Š Deliverables

* Machine Learning Output: CSV files with predictions & feature importance.
* Tableau Dashboard: Visual insights by tenure, contract type, charges, and customer segments.
* KPIs & Filters: Business-friendly indicators for decision-making.

## ðŸŽ¯ Outcomes

* Identified top churn drivers (e.g., contract type, tenure, monthly charges).
* Highlighted high-risk customers using model predictions.
* Delivered a data-driven decision support system for customer retention.
